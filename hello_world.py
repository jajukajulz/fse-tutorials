'''
This is a multi-line comment in Python using triple-quoted strings.
A multi-line comment is also known as a docstrings and  used in Python to provide 
documentation for modules, functions, classes, and methods i.e. describe the purpose, behavior, 
and usage of the code element they are attached to. 
Docstrings can be accessed at runtime using the built-in Python __doc__ attribute.

The purpose of commenting out multiple lines in Python 
is to disable or exclude a block of code from execution.
